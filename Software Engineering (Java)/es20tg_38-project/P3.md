 - [Creates a clarification comment in chat view](./frontend/tests/e2e/specs/teacher/clarificationComment.js#L38)

#### Rationale
We tested a common use case of this system by creating a Quizz and then responding to that quiz, creating therefore a solved quizz. We used this solved quizz to test the creation of a clarification request and the creation of a clarification comment, in the different ways available to the user. We also tested the view of this clarification by a student.This way we were able to test all the features implemented so far in our functionality.

### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

- [creates a tournament](./frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/tournamentsCalendar.js#L12-L14)
- [creates a tournament and displays its topics](./frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/tournamentsCalendar.js#L16-L19)
- [creates a tournament, displays its topics and enrolls in it](./frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/tournamentsCalendar.js#L21-L26)
- [creates 2 tournaments and enrolls in them](./frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/tournamentsCalendar.js#L28-L35)

#### Rationale
- The end-to-end tests defined allows to determine in a small amount of time if the Tournament functionalities such as `Create Tournament`, `List Opened Tournaments` and `Enroll in Opened Tournaments` continues working when we change our code.
- We first tested the independent functionality `Create Tournament` because without it the other functionalities would be untestable.
- Then we tested the functionality `List Opened Tournaments` by checking the topics of a tournament.
- Then we tested the functionality `Enroll in Opened Tournaments` by enrolling twice in tournaments.
- We also tested the usual behavior performed by the users by checking the topics of a tournament and enrolling in it.

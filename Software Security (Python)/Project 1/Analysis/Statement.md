# Software Security - Project 1

## Analysis - Phase 1

Scenario:
1. Our development is still in its early stages but we want already to perform a (Black-Box) Security Assessment of the Application.
2. You should analyse all possible sources of Vulnerabilities on it.
3. For each Vulnerability you identify you should provide a PoC (i.e. a Python Script) that illustrates the presence of such Vulnerability.
4. Each PoC should also be documented with a small text that explains its Impact and Steps to Reproduce.

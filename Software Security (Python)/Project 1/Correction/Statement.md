# Software Security - Project 1

## Correction - Phase 2

Scenario:
1. You are a Software Engineer and you developed the Application.
2. Your Company hired someone to test your Application (Forget now that you did it).
3. Your Manager came up with the Report of the Vulnerabilities and ask you to fix it.
4. You can fix it as you wish as long as you keep the Functionality of the Application.
5. On the other hand your Manager will not give you infinite time to do it so you better change as little as possible and do not think about doing a complete refactoring of the Application.
